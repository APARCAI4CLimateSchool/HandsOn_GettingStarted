    "These tutorials are organized around [xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org), which provides a powerful set of tools for analyzing climate data, including spatial distributions and time series. Because the time for this training is limited, we dive right into using [xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org) without working through the [basic](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) and [intermediate](https://pandas.pydata.org/) building blocks that xarray extends. Links to resources that provide additional details on those building blocks are included throughout.  \n",

    "One building block that does require special mention is modules. Python is a modular language, meaning that we often use it by loading a number of specialized extensions. This reliance on modules has both advantages and disadvantages. The most important advantages are that\n",
    "1. We can each build our own bespoke programming environment (or [environments](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/tools/working-with-conda/environments)) based around the tools we use most often\n",
    "2. We only need to load the tools we will actually use for any given task\n",
    "3. Code is more readable and tracable\n",
    "\n",
    "The main disadvantages are that\n",
    "1. Modules may conflict with each other, and these conflicts can in some cases break the environment\n",
    "2. Many modules are maintained by volunteers, who may or may not have time to keep them updated\n",
